**Composition**
- Using proximity, alignment, contrast, asymmetry, color, and repetition to build hierarchy and enhance usability
-  Simple system, simple composition
-  Building Hierarchy for complex systems
  - How can we build a hierarchy with design elements to structure information and guide people’s eyes?

**4 Principles of Composition (of many)**
- Proximity
  - Physical closeness implies a relationship and visually communicates things
  - Group related items together
  - Separate items that are not related
- Whitespace:
  - Helps to group items
 - Helps readers scan
 - Suggestions:
  - Put margins (white space) around all content.
  - Maintain a sense of proportion between the object and its surroundings.
  - Don’t crowd controls together (even if grouped).
- Alignment
  - Nothing should be placed arbitrarily. 
  - Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.
  - Avoid center-aligned text
  - Main goal: unify and organize content
  - Be conscious of where you place items
  - Work within a grid
  - Use centered alignment sparingly and for a purpose
- Repetition
  - Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.
  - Partially about consistency (Norman) but goes even further to unify the design.
  - Could be any aspect of the design (fonts, colors, design elements, proximity, alignment)
  - Main goal: unify and provide visual interest.
  - Create repetition by Strengthening repetitions that already exist and creating new ones to enhance the design
  - Avoid over-repetition (it’s annoying)
- Contrast
  - Contrast to draw a reader’s eye to certain parts of the page
  - Contrast can be created in many ways:
  - Size
  - Color (cool v. warm)
  - Whitespace
  - Asymmetry
  - Be bold!
  - For contrast to be effective, it must be strong
  - Two main goals
  - Create visual interest
  - Effective information organization
  - Effective contrast is strong
  - Elements have to be styled very differently
  - Be bold!

**Font Selection Guidelines**
- Aim for simplicity and contrast 
  - Don't use more than 2 or 3 fonts
  - One for body text, one for titles and headings
- Use font features to create contrast
  - Size, color, weight (e.g. bold), style (e.g. caps)
- No more than 3-4 font varieties
  - Don’t mix fonts that serve a similar purpose
  - Don’t use two different serif fonts for body copy
- Be generous with whitespace
  - Always leave margins around body text
  - Never pack it tightly against an edge
- Use generous line height (but not too far away)
  - Make sure body text is not crowded
  - CSS: line-height: 120% or more
- Keep text paragraphs narrow
  - About 60 - 75 characters / 12 - 15 words
  - Generally easier to read.
